      A hotdog is a popular food item consisting of a cooked sausage, typically
      made from beef or pork, served in a sliced bun. It is often garnished with
      mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, sauerkraut, or cheese.
      Hotdogs are commonly enjoyed at barbecues, sporting events, and street
      fairs.

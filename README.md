# Hotdog, Not Hotdog

## What it is

This project is a small and simple website designed to determine whether a given image is a hot dog or not

## How it Works

The model was created with the use of [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) by Google. The model has two classes, hot dog or not and is trained on a dataset of over 100 images.

## Using it

Simply press the start button and once you enable your camera, the website will run the image through the model and tell you whether or not it sees a hot dog, followed by it's confidence level from 0% to 100%.
